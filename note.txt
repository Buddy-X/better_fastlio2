kitti2bag  需要用conda 创建python2环境  因为tf只能用于py2环境   一直输入kitti2bag查找缺少哪些包 然后 pip install ** 即可
没有用sc来回环
need a fileplayer

// TODO:
have we selected sc to get global pose?
how to use teaser ++  to cover poses?
learn imu_lidar_localization?
how to conclude that hdl_localization is poor?

why i can't install ceres?? or glog ??   i have solved it, by refine google-glog + gflags

global:  sc (transform in yaw) + icp to get score, we should publish all candicates !!   get a coarse global pose
correct:  how to get a precise initial pose?  
                    if the calculated "coarse global pose" is not satisfied, we can select to refine it by manual process. but we wanna use teaser the final pose.
online relocalization: we still use the iESKF in fastlio2, including imu and lidar, but the primary difference is that the measurement function is replaced by the scan2map match between current scan and prior local map.
                                            we guess that the real-time performance is ok, at least the precision of relocalization is perfect like fastlio2.
incremental mapping: we should use the map manager in repo: lidar_imu_localization.

so, the first question is to develop a map manager to manage the prior map.

there are problems in nearcloud, why it is static??
the mode of lio should be reconstructed
the topics of odometry and path should be refined
